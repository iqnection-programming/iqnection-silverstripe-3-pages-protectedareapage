<h2>SilverStripe Protected Area</h2>
<p>Protected Area Page is a page type that allows access to only users specific users. Users are assigned to groups, and groups are provided permission to certain pages.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>To get started, first create a page with a type Protected Area Page. Usually, this page is at the root of the site. By default, this page will be hidden from navigation and will not be indexed by search engines, but you may change these settings in the Settings tab while editing the page in the CMS.</p>

<p>Once your pages is setup, you'll likely want to create sub-pages. You can choose any page type you wish, as long as it lives under a Protected Area Page, the page will be secure. The depth of the page structure does not matter.</p>

<h3>Setting Up User Groups</h3>
<p>Now that you've setup your page structure, you'll want to create the user groups that can access each page. Each user group can be set to access only some of the pages, or all of the pages. The access is controlled by the deepest page. You can select which pages a particular group can access when editing the group, or you can select them at the page level. When editing a page that lives under a protected area, click the Access Control tab. From here you can search the different user groups and grant access by linking them to the page.</p>

<p>Example Page Structure:<br />
Secure Area<br />
Secure Area / Documents<br />
Secure Area / Documents / Forms<br />
Secure Area / Documents / Client Records</p>

<p>In the above example page structure, if you were to provide a group access to [Secure Area / Documents] only, the users WILL NOT be able to access [Secure Area / Documents / Forms] or any other sub-pages.</p>

<p>If you provided group access to [Secure Area / Documents / Forms], the users by default will also have access to [Secure Area] &amp; [Secure Area / Documents], but will not have access to [Secure Area / Documents / Client Records].</p>

<p>So it is a good idea to structure your deepest level pages to have the content that needs to be secure, and divide that content by what groups may or may not have access to.</p>

<p><strong>*Note:</strong> If a new bottom level page is added after the groups are setup, you will need to edit the user groups that should have access, and add that page as an allowed page. You may also add user groups directly at the page level, as mentioned above.</p>

<h3>Adding Users</h3>
<p>You will want to setup users last. After adding a new user, the user will be sent an email that contains a link to the secure area and their login credentials. So if this information isn't prepared in advance, the user will not know how to access the content. When adding a new user, provide as much information as possible, all fields may be required depending on your specific configuration. You will need to select the groups the user is assigned to before saving the user for the first time. The groups are needed to determine which pages the user will have access to. If your application allows admins to set the password, you should only enter a password if you are setting it for the first time, or changing it.</p>

<p>* If your configuration will auto generate passwords, you may leave the password field blank on first save, and the system will generate a random password for you.</p>

<p>* User passwords are store securely and cannot be retrieved. If a user loses their password, they must request a new password, or you must reset their password, depending on the configuration of your application.</p>

<h3>Developer Configuration</h3>
<p>Your developer can change configurations to allow users and/or admins to change account passwords, or allow the system to auto generate passwords. The minimum password length can also be set to require more secure passwords. By default, the minimum password length is 6 characters. Please contact your developer to make any changes to your application's configuration</p>
